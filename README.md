Project management docs from "Project Management for the Unofficial Project Management" Kogon, Blakemore, and Wood

_How to use these documents:_  
These documents are intended to be used sequentially throughout a project's lifecycle to ensure that a project continues on track and will be completed in the allotted time. These tools make defining scope, ownership, and communication clear and as objective as possible. Special emphasis is given to agreement and sign off. Tools are also available to ensure that risk is managed appropriately- First by preemptively identifying risks and devising mitigation plans, but through communication and transparency.

_What are these documents?_

1. Key stakeholder interview: Interview structure to guide project definitions from people who determine the success or failure of a project.

2. Project scope statement: A tool for defining the boundaries of a project; includes project purpose, description, desired results, communication needs, constraints, exclusions, and stakeholder approvals.

3. Risk matrix: Framework for sizing the relative importance of risks.

4. Risk management plan: Tool to itemize strategy for dealing with risks should they arise.

5. Communication plan: Outline and schedule of necessary communications during an engagement.

6. Team accountability session: A brief and motivating meeting with the sole intent of letting the team evaluate the overall project to see if they are winning or losing. Each team member commits to one or two responsibilities that will keep the project on track for that week. Everyone plays to win together.

7. Conversation planner: A guide to communicate how a team member's actions are impacting the project and the team with the goal of identifying issues, being empathetic toward one another, and developing a joint plan to resolve those issues.

8. Project status report: A tool to take stock of a project's current status. Allows project managers to easily and clearly communicate what is at risk of being delayed or left incomplete and identifies necessary steps toward resolution.

9. Project change request: A proposal to modify any document, deliverable, or baseline.

10. Close checklist: A series of tasks and milestones that must be completed before a project is considered done.
